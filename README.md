# Student Management System (Kotlin)

## Description
This project is a console-based Student Management application written in Kotlin.
It demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts and functional programming
features such as lambdas and higher-order functions.

The application allows managing students and their courses through a simple
menu-based interface. All data is stored in memory during program execution.

## Features
- Add, edit, list, search, and delete students
- Manage courses for each student (add/remove)
- Input validation and error handling
- Sorting, filtering, and statistics using lambdas

## Technologies
- Kotlin
- Console-based application
- In-memory storage (MutableList)

## How to Run
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Kotlin-compatible IDE.
2. Make sure Kotlin/JVM is configured.
3. Run the `main()` function.
4. Follow the menu instructions in the console.

## Assumptions
- Data is stored only during program execution (no persistence).
- Student ID is generated automatically.
- Course credits are fixed for simplicity.
